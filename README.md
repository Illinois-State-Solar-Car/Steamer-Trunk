# Steamer Trunk
the .prt design for the steamer trunk.

This is a redesign of the steamer trunk we already have. The final piece should be no larger than 73.125" tall and 48" wide when folded up. Design permitting, there should be 5 rows of 2" tall drawers on the left half and 3 rows of drawers - 1 being 3.5" tall and 2 being 3.25" tall. There should also be a shelf that is 36.625" off of the ground and 13" tall. All other design elements are up to the designer.
